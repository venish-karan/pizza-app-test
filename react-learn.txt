File =>
    node_modules 
        => contains library needed for react app

    public 
        => contains images, public assests


    src 
        => contains all the code we write

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

commands:

npx create-react-App 
    => is an tool to create a react project


yarn uses caching 
    => it is fast => instead we can use npm run 'start'


render is in react-dom library 
    => render(elements we want to render, in which tag we want to render)


App.js is a root component 
    => the part we want to render (<App />);


<> </> => this is fragments 
    => used to combine different elements


npm install react-router-dom 
    => for multiple pages in our app => to navigate to diff pages

react-router-dom
    => <Route path=""> // path is a value or also called as props

curly braces in html are used for dynamic purpose

rafce (boiler template) => react, arrow, funtional component, export


life hooks : when we want to do something after some changes had happened

useEffect(()=> {},[products]) are dependencies array, [] if empty it will run for once

we are using {} braces in import statement because we have not exported it in default mode.

ex: import { CartContext } from "./Cartcontext";

// preventDefault is used here because we have wrapped the product component in link anchor tag
and prevents from redirecting

// stopPropogation is used when we use the onclick on the outer div as well as on button onclick is used.
